## 📖 The Sentinel Story

In the Nigerian fintech landscape, fraud isn't just a "data problem"—it’s a sophisticated, evolving challenge that targets specific local behaviors. Traditional, generic fraud models often fail here because they don't understand the nuance of a **USSD transfer at 2:00 AM**, the surge of activity during **Salary Week**, or the high-velocity nature of **Opay/Moniepoint** transactions.

**Sentinel** was built to bridge this gap. It doesn't just look at numbers; it looks at patterns. By combining "Surgical" feature engineering (like balance depletion ratios) with a high-performance ensemble of AI models, Sentinel protects both the bank's bottom line and the customer's peace of mind.

> "We built Sentinel to ensure that a legitimate customer in Lagos can spend their money without friction, while a fraudster in a dark room is blocked before the 'Send' button is even cold."

## 🚀 Overview

Sentinel is a production-grade Fraud Detection API that processes transactions in real-time. It uses a **Voting Ensemble (Random Forest + XGBoost + LightGBM)** to predict the probability of fraud with surgical precision.

### Why Sentinel is different:
* **Locally Contextual:** Engineered specifically for Nigerian banking triggers (USSD, BVN-linkage, Location-based spending).
* **Explainable AI:** Every "BLOCK" decision comes with a human-readable reason and a SHAP-based technical breakdown.
* **Business First:** Includes a built-in ROI calculator that translates model accuracy into **Naira Saved**.

## 📈 Model Performance

We don't just chase high accuracy; we chase **Precision**. In fraud detection, a "False Positive" means a frustrated customer who can't pay for their dinner. Sentinel is tuned to avoid that.

| Metric | Result | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AUC-ROC** | **96.7%** | Excellent ability to distinguish between fraud and legit. |
| **Precision** | **99.8%** | Only 4 "False Alarms" out of 12,000+ transactions. |
| **Recall** | **87.9%** | We catch nearly 9 out of every 10 fraud attempts. |
| **False Positive Rate** | **0.03%** | Virtually zero friction for legitimate customers. |

**Net Business Impact (Test Set):**
* **Total Fraud Prevented:** ₦36,165,467.60
* **Customer Friction Cost:** -₦10,000.00
* **Net Profit:** **₦36,155,467.60**

## ✨ Features

* **⚡ Real-Time Scoring:** Sub-100ms inference using FastAPI and optimized model artifacts.
* **🧠 Surgical Engineering:** 26+ features including "Midnight High-Value Shock" and "Balance Depletion Ratio."
* **🔗 Redis-Powered Idempotency:** Prevents duplicate processing of transactions during network retries.
* **🚩 Automated Webhooks:** Sends instant POST alerts to your internal security systems for "High Risk" flags.
* **✍️ AI Executive Summaries:** Integrates **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** to write professional daily fraud reports for management.
* **🔍 Explainability (SHAP):** Transparent AI that tells you *why* it flagged a transaction (e.g., "Amount is 30x higher than typical for Abuja").

```
## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* **Python 3.10+**: Core programming environment.
* **Redis Server**: Required for real-time idempotency and transaction caching (defaults to in-memory if Redis is unavailable).
* **Gemini API Key**: Required for generating the AI Fraud Summary reports.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/celpha2svx/sentinel-fraud-detection.git
   cd sentinel-fraud-detection
   
2. Set up the virtual environment:python -m venv venv
 ```bash
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Mac/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
 ```
3. Install dependencies:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory:
```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
    REDIS_HOST=localhost
    REDIS_PORT=6379
 ```
## Usage:
1. Start the Sentinel Service:
```
 uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```
2. Access the Interactive Docs:
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs in your browser to test endpoints via Swagger UI.
### API Testing
​Run the automated test script to simulate a high-risk transaction and verify the SHAP explanation engine:
```
python test_sentinel.py
```
 # Use Cases
* Fintech Wallets: Block "Midnight Sweeper" attacks where compromised accounts are drained via USSD while the owner sleeps.
* E-Commerce Checkouts: Flag high-value orders that deviate significantly from a user's 30-day spending baseline.
* Agency Banking: Monitor POS terminals for unusual transaction velocity or large withdrawals in high-risk geographical zones. License
